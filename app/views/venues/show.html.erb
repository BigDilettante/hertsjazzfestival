					<p>This year our Festival is hosted by the Rhodes Arts Complex in Bishops Stortford. The Rhodes was a regular venue for British jazz in the 50s and 60s, presenting gigs by Tubby Hayes, Humphrey Lyttleton, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Ken Colyer, George Melly and many more. We are proud to be reviving a great tradition.</p>
